## Introduction


### What is React?

</div>

ReactJS, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces,makes the development of UI components easy and modular.
React JS was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook and open sourced to the world by Facebook and Instagram.

### The key features of React are:

- Component-based architecture: A Component is the smallest unit in a React application. Anything that you want to render on the browser can be rendered through components. Components help in maintainability and re-usability.
- Virtual DOM: React uses virtual DOM concept for DOM manipulation which improves the performance of the application
Unidirectional data flow:  React‚Äôs one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast and easy for debugging.
- JSX syntax: React used JSX syntax which is similar to XML and HTML syntax which makes it easy for writing markup and binding events in components 
- SEO performance: The SEO performance can be improved using the server-side rendering concept. We can develop isomorphic applications using React which increases the SEO performance.

### Angular is one of the popular frameworks used for UI development. Let us compare React and Angular in brief:

| REACT | ANGULAR |
| ----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| React is a small view library | Angular is a full framework | 
| React covers only the rendering and event handling part | Angular provides the complete solution for front-end development |
| Presentation code in JavaScript powered by JSX | Presentation code in HTML embedded with JavaScript expressions |
| React's core size is smaller than Angular, so bit fast | Angular being a framework contains a lot of code, resulting in longer load time |
| React is very flexible | Angular has less flexibility |
| Great performer, since it uses Virtual DOM | Angular uses actual DOM which affects its performance |
